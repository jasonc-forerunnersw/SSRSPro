IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW FOR EACH SERVER YOU PROPERLY LICENSE.

1. **1.** OVERVIEW.
  1. **a.** Software. The software includes

- the software; and
- additional software that may only be used with the software directly, or indirectly through other additional software.

1.
  1. **b.** License Model. The software is licensed based on the:

- Application License Model - number of separate application instances which you run instances of the software.

1.
  1. **c.** Licensing Terminology.

- **Instance.** You create an &quot;instance&quot; of software by executing the software&#39;s setup or install procedure. You also create an instance of software by duplicating an existing instance. References to software in this agreement include &quot;instances&quot; of the software.
- **Run an Instance.** You &quot;run an instance&quot; of software by loading it into memory and executing one or more of its instructions. Once running, an instance is considered to be running (whether or not its instructions continue to execute) until it is removed from memory.
- **Operating System Environment.** An &quot;operating system environment&quot; is

- all or part of an operating system instance, or all or part of a virtual (or otherwise emulated) operating system instance which enables separate machine identity (primary computer name or similar unique identifier) or separate administrative rights, and
- instances of applications, if any, configured to run on the operating system instance or parts identified above.

There are two types of operating system environments, physical and virtual. A physical operating system environment is configured to run directly on a physical hardware system. The operating system instance used to run hardware virtualization software (e.g. Microsoft Virtual Server or similar technologies) or to provide hardware virtualization services (e.g. Microsoft virtualization technology or similar technologies) is considered part of the physical operating system environment. A virtual operating system environment is configured to run on a virtual (or otherwise emulated) hardware system. A physical hardware system can have either or both of the following:

- ne physical operating system environment
- ne or more virtual operating system environments.

- **Server.** A server is a physical hardware system capable of running the software. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a separate physical hardware system.
- **Assigning a License.** To assign a license means simply to designate that license to one application.

1. **2.** TERMS FOR APPLICATION LICENSE MODEL.
  1. **a.** Licensing an Application. Before you run instances of the software on a server, you must determine the required number of software licenses and assign those licenses to that application as described below.
    1. **i.**** Determining the Number of Licenses Required.** To run instances of the software in a physical or virtual operating system environment on a server, you need a software license for that application.
    2. **ii.**** License Term.**  Licenses are valid for 1 year (365 days) from purchase.  After the term the software will revert to the FREE license functionality including but not limited reduced features and functionality.

4. **8.** DOWNGRADE. Instead of creating, storing and using the software, for each permitted instance, you may create, store and use an instance of an earlier version. This agreement applies to your use of the earlier version. If the earlier version includes different components, any terms for those components in the agreement that comes with the earlier version apply to your use of them. Forerunner Software is not obligated to supply earlier versions to you. At any time, you may replace an earlier version with this version of the software.
5. **9.**** TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY.** The first user of the software may transfer it, this agreement directly to a third party.

10. **14.** LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country.

11. **15.** LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM FORERUNNER SOFTWARE AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

This limitation applies to

- anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
- claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if

- repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or
- Forerunner Software knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
